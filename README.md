# Portfolio starter kit

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10.0.6 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)!

### Getting started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy

Follow the [Netlify setup guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) to link this repo to a Netlify site.

Afterwards, pushing to `main` should auto-deploy your site to production.
